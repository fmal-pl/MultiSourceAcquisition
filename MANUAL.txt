// ================================================================== Requirements
- Windows 8 or higher 
Required for Kinect 2. Should you decide to modify app to work without Kinect 2 it will not need W8 anymore.
- .NET Framework 4.5
- Kinect 2 drivers & SDK
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561
- CL Eye Platform Driver & SDK (only if you wish to use the PS3Eye cameras)
https://codelaboratories.com/products/eye/
Please note, that this is NOT a free library
- Other libs are provided and include:
(appropriate license files can be found with the provided addresses)
csmatio	(http://sourceforge.net/projects/csmatio/)
zlib.net (http://zlib.net/)
AForge.NET (http://www.aforgenet.com/)
FFMPEG (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
MoreLinq (https://code.google.com/p/morelinq/)

Note: Using accelerometers is optional. Currently supported accelerometer glove is a custom system, but you can easily modify the code to use other accelerometers. In this case you need to use proper drivers for your devices.
If you're not using accelerometers at all the application will work fine without any additional drivers.


// ================================================================== How to run
From source code: build the solution and run
From executable: run MultiSourceAcqMain.exe


// ================================================================== Interface
The graphical interface is divided into 3 sections:

Presentation section (on the left) 
- Displays output from all devices

Control section (in the middle):
- Device-specific settings (PS3Eye, Acc glove)
- Start/stop - here you need to select the devices and start them
Acc glove is started separately
Depth and color mapping for Kinect are selected here as well
- Display settings - you can change what is displayed
Important: displaying performance hides 'quick action panel'
- Recorder settings
Choose path
Enter action and person name
Select codec and bitrate
Start & stop recording sample
Counter increments automatically
Remove last recording if needed
 
Performance/Quick action section:
- Displays full performance (if Display Performance is checked) or
- Displays Quick action panel and most important performance indices
Click an item on the list to copy it as current action in the Recording settings section


// ================================================================== Quick start (Kinect 2)
How to quickly record Kinect 2 samples
- Install Kinect 2 drivers and SDK, connect Kinect 2
- Start the application
- In the Start/Stop section select 'Kinect 2', optionally set depth and/or color mapping
- Press 'Start devices' button, video from Kinect 2 should appear on the left
- Set all recording settings (path, action and person name, codec, bitrate)
- Press 'Start recording' buttton, perform some action in front of the Kinect 2, press 'Stop recording'
- Go to the chosen path, verify that the data has been recorded correctly


// ================================================================== Settings & Quick action panel
All settings should be self-explanatory ;)
Settings are saved in 'settings' file, in the main application directory. 
Settings are saved when application is closed or 'Save settings' button is pressed.

Quick action panel reads lists from quick_action directory located in the main application directory.
The quick_action directory is automatically created if it doesn't already exist.
Each list of actions is stored as a single txt file, where each line is one action on the list.
To modify a list simply modfy corresponding txt file.
To add or remove a list simply add or remove a txt file.
